Error Codes
===========
This page tries to document all possible errors that can arise.
Every error is documented with causes and possible fixes.
Error codes can be recognized by and ``E`` followed by three digits.
Error codes start counting at ``100`` and for now there are is no structure in how the errors are sorted.
This way error codes can easily be recognized and communicated with others,
without having to repeat the whole error description.

.. note:: This page is still a work in progress and might not contain all errors you can encounter.
          If you encounter an error that is not documented, consider creating
          `an issue <https://github.com/project-march/tutorials/issues/new/choose>`_ or
          `pull request <https://github.com/project-march/tutorials>`_.

**Error list**

.. contents:: :local:


..  From here start the error descriptions. Every error is formatted as a
    subsection that starts with '``EXXX``: ' followed by a short title of the error.
    Furthermore, every error subsection should be preceded by a label of the error, i.e. '.. _exxx:'.
    Finally, the error subsection should contain a short description, causes and possible fixes.


.. _e100:

``E100``: Placeholder error
---------------------------
This should be a short description of the error.

**Cause:** You did this thing wrong

**Fix:** Do this and that and then it may be solved
