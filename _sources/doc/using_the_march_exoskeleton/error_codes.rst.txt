Error Codes
===========
This page tries to document all possible errors that can arise.
Every error is documented with causes and possible fixes.
Error codes can be recognized by and ``E`` followed by three digits.
Error codes start counting at ``100`` and for now there are is no structure in how the errors are sorted.
This way error codes can easily be recognized and communicated with others,
without having to repeat the whole error description.

.. note:: This page is still a work in progress and might not contain all errors you can encounter.
          If you encounter an error that is not documented, consider creating
          `an issue <https://github.com/project-march/tutorials/issues/new/choose>`_ or
          `pull request <https://github.com/project-march/tutorials>`_.

**Error list**

.. contents:: :local:


..  From here start the error descriptions. Every error is formatted as a
    subsection that starts with '``EXXX``: ' followed by a short title of the error.
    Furthermore, every error subsection should be preceded by a label of the error, i.e. '.. _exxx:'.
    Finally, the error subsection should contain a short description, causes and possible fixes.


.. _e100:

``E100``: Invalid actuation mode
--------------------------------
An invalid actuation mode was used to perform an action.

**Cause:** The motor controllers have two modes for actuation: position and effort.
With position you can only actuate to a target position using ``actuateRad()``.
In effort mode you can only actuate using a target torque using ``actuateTorque()``.
This error was caused by mixing the actuate methods and actuation modes. See
the detailed description for which mode the controller was actually in.

**Fix:** Check if the actuation mode defined in the :hardware-interface:`robots yaml <march_hardware_builder/robots>`
you use is consistent with the methods you are using to actuate the joint.


.. _e101:

``E101``: Invalid actuate position
----------------------------------
Invalid IU position command.

**Cause:** The position you are trying to actuate to is not a valid target within the range of the joint.

**Fix:** Check that the IU limits defined in the :hardware-interface:`robots yaml <march_hardware_builder/robots>`
under ``joints/<joint_name>/imotioncube/encoder`` match the actual limits of the joint.


.. _e102:

``E102``: Encoder reset
-----------------------
An encoder has reset and reads an incorrect value.

**Cause:** The cause is still unknown.

**Fix:** This error happens sometimes during startup and the only thing you
can do is try again. This error will probably be removed once this issue has
been fixed.


.. _e103:

``E103``: Outside hard limits
-----------------------------
A joint is outside its defined hard limits.

**Cause:** A joint was found to be outside its defined hard limits in the
:hardware-interface:`robots yaml <march_hardware_builder/robots>`.

**Fix:** Check that the IU limits defined in the :hardware-interface:`robots yaml <march_hardware_builder/robots>`
under ``joints/<joint_name>/imotioncube/encoder`` match the actual limits of the joint and recalibrate if necessary.


.. _e104:

``E104``: Target exceeds max difference
---------------------------------------
The target position exceeds the max allowed difference from the current position.

**Cause:** The given target position is greater than the maximum allowed difference
between target and actual position. This could cause dangerous situations if
you were to actuate a long distance in a short amount of time.

**Fix:** This is a safety measure and most of time indicates that the joints
are behind their trajectory path.


.. _e105:

``E105``: Target torque exceeds max torque
------------------------------------------
The target torque exceeds the max allowed torque

**Cause:** The maximum given target torque is greater than the joints
can actuate. This could cause dangerous situations where the joints could be
negatively affected.

**Fix:** This is a safety measure and most of time indicates that the joints
are behind their trajectory path.


.. _e106:

``E106``: PDO object not defined
--------------------------------
The to be added PDO object was not defined.

**Cause:** The PDO that is being mapped does not have a defined address and size.

**Fix:** Check that the PDO is defined in the ``all_objects`` map in the
:hardware-interface:`PDOmap <march_hardware/src/PDOmap.cpp>` class.


.. _e107:

``E107``: PDO register overflow
-------------------------------
The PDO map could not fit within the registers

**Cause:** There exist 4 registers with 64 bits each to be filled with PDO maps.
This error indicates that the added PDO exceeded 4*64=256 bits.

**Fix:** Check that you actually need all the mapped PDOs and remove some that
you are not using until you are at or below the 256 bits.


.. _e108:

``E108``: Writing initial settings failed
-----------------------------------------
Failed to write initial settings to slave required for operation.

**Cause:** Before setting all ethercat slaves to operational mode, the master
writes some settings required during operation. If such a write command fails,
it means that the master did not get any confirmation that the value was written.
This could have several causes: A slave was (temporarily) lost during writing
or the slave does not allow writing the value to that address.

**Fix:** Check the connection between the faulty slave and the master or
check that you write the correct sized (8, 16, 32 bit) value to the correct address.

.. _e999:

``E999``: Unknown error
-----------------------
Unknown error occurred which was not given an error code.

**Cause:** An ``HardwareException`` was thrown without specifying an ``ErrorType``.

**Fix:** Find where this exception was thrown and create a documented error.
